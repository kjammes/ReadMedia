This application will be built in phases and new feature will be added incrementally.

This repo only includes back-end code. Front-end code will be in a separate repository(Framework/Library yet to be decided).

As of now we only have two APIs

1. For fetching all the Post objects from database
2. For saving a Post object to database

Following are the technologies used in this repo
1. Programming Language - Kotlin
2. Framework - Spring Boot
3. Primary DB - Postgres
4. DB for search - Elasticsearch (Yet to add code for connecting to ElasticSearch)
